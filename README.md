# Self-Service-Installer

Self Service is a distributed backend service solution from RelayX that enables secure, decentralized communication between RelayApp frontends and application services through RelayX Network's P2P infrastructure.

This repository provides pre-built Self Service node installation packages, helping developers deploy secure backend proxy services without exposing services to the public internet. By leveraging encrypted P2P tunnels, Self Service eliminates traditional server costs while providing enhanced privacy protection and censorship resistance.
